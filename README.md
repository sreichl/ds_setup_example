# Data Science Setup Example
The accompanying example repository to my tutorial & resource blog post: ["A Data Scientist's Guide to a Comprehensive Setup"](http://setup.polytechnist.me)

**TL;DR:** This is a tutorial and resource describing an easy, robust, reproducible, language- and platform-agnostic setup for data processing, analysis, and visualization by means of package and environment management (conda); software development with an integrated development environment (JupyterLab); distribution and version control (GitHub); workflow management (Snakemake) and containerization (Singularity).
